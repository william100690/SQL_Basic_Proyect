# SQL_Basic_Proyect


The objective of this project is to start familiarizing with the SQL language. For this purpose, we will use the MySQL relational database management system to develop the project.

For this project, we are going to create a database for a computer store, generate different tables within the database, and load data into these tables.

* Once the database is ready, we will perform different types of queries:

  Query on a single table
  
  Inner join query (multitable composition)
  
  Outer join query (multitable composition)
  
  Summary queries
  
  Subqueries with the WHERE clause
    Subqueries with basic comparison operators
    Subqueries with ALL and ANY
    Subqueries with IN and NOT IN
    Subqueries with EXISTS and NOT EXISTS
    Correlated subqueries
    
  Subqueries with the HAVING clause
